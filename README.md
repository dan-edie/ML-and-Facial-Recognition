Something that is of interest to me while learning machine learning techniques is facial recognition. It is a subject that is both interesting, but fraught with possibilities of abuse. Privacy concerns abound, and the use by surveillance can be a dangerous precident.

I really got interested in facial recognition when Twitter users began to notice a problem with how Twitter would crop pictures down that included faces. At first, the test was to use two photographs and a blank space, picture on top of space on top of picture. Users noticed that if you had Black or BIPOC people and a white person, all the time, the white person was the image showed in the crop. It did not matter what order the pictures were in, the white person was always the focus. The only way this was countered was when either the image of the Black person was scaled up enormously, or if the image colors were reversed. Other cropped images showed the same issues: white or light colored skin was getting preference over dark.

I want to see if this is something baked into the algorithm, or is this some instance where a test-train-val split was not randomized. I've never worked with images and ML before, so this will be an interesting thread to start to follow.
